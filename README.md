# Portable-Squawk-Code-Generator
Created to have a squawk code generator able to be run locally without having to run a server environment.
For my use of creating discreet squawk codes for VFR aircraft operating in Class B airspace during virtual ATC sessions on The Flight Lounge (https://discord.gg/TFL server)
