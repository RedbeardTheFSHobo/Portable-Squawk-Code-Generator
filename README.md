# Portable-Squawk-Code-Generator
Created to have a squawk code generator able to be run locally without having to run a server environment.

JavaScript version of a code originally written in PHP and run on a local XAMPP server.

Completely portable with no local dependencies (only requirement is an internet connection to retrieve code libraries),linked to officially hosted Bootstrap and jQuery libraries.

For my use of creating discreet squawk codes for VFR aircraft operating in Class B airspace during virtual ATC sessions on The Flight Lounge (https://discord.gg/TFLserver)
